Time complexity : it is dependent on input size ,
                  it defines rough idea about how many time is requird for runing code 

Space complexity : it is dependent on size code and decleartion of variables 
                   if gives rough idea about how mach storage or ram is requird for our code 

NOTE THAT ::: efficiency code solution is always inversely proposinal to (Time && Space) complexity;
